Why LessCSS ?
=============


Big part of Sona framework are build around LessCSS. It is not becouse Less is
the only thing that we can use in modern frontend development. Actualy there
are other options we'll discuse them here and compare them to Less.

 * Classical solution RAW HTML/CSS
 * Old facioned CSS-only layouts frameworks. 960gs, Bluepring, etc
 * Using CSS preprocessors like Less, SASS/SCSS, Stylus
 * Uning framewokrs for preprocessors.


LessCSS have a lot of benefits in opposite to raw CSS.


First of all Less is preprocessor so its generetes CSS code
for you. So its much easyer and `less` thing to type to have
all needed CSS generated automagicaly by less.
(actually with Less you can write less code)
In IT writing less code (or doing less job) is not about beeng lazy,
it's about beeng smart enought to 


Less mixins variables and functions help to keep you layout code DRY
(Do not repeat yourself)
